# This script allows to run some of the basic management tasks needed by the
# o11s development workflow (see more in ${DISTRO11S}/doc/open80211s-kernel.txt)
# 
# Implemented functionalities:
#
# - Rebase all the feature branches with the HEAD of wireless-testing. The
#   rebased branches (ft-*-can) will be available in your working directory,
#   ready to be tested and pushed upstream.
#
#   Also, if the script detects that a feature branch is already present in the
#   latest wireless-testing, it will delete that branch from the repository.
#
# - Recreate bleeding-edge: it will rebase all the feature branches with the
#   latest WT and then merge them all in bleeding-edge-can.
#
# - Automatic testing: if using the flag -t with any of the features above, it
#   will build, install and test the candidate branches.
#
# Tips & Tricks:
#
# - The script uses stamp files in order to be able to resume its activity if
#   it fails performing any operation. So, if you find any merging or rebasing
#   issue, please fix the conflicts and run the script again (with the same
#   options).
#
# - This script produces two types of branches:
#
#   + candidate branches (*-can): they represent the final product of the script.
#     They are meant to be tested and pushed by the release manager.
#
#   + temporary branches (*-tmp): these are temporary branches that are deleted
#     once the script finishes. If the script is interrupted for any reason, 
#     they will be.
